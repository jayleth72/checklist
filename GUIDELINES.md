# Project Guidelines

## Purpose
This document outlines the guidelines for working with this checklist system.

## File Organization
- Keep checklists in markdown format
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Link to related documents when needed

## Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Each checklist item should be clear and actionable
2. **Link References**: When items reference other documents, include links
3. **Keep Updated**: Regularly review and update checklists
4. **Version Control**: Track changes to checklists in git

## Linking to Files
You can link to files in several ways:

### Relative Links
Use relative paths for files in the same repository:
```markdown
[Link to template](CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md)
```

### Absolute Links
Use full URLs for external resources:
```markdown
[External Resource](https://example.com/document.pdf)
```

### File References
Reference specific sections in documents:
```markdown
[Guidelines Section](GUIDELINES.md#file-organization)
```
